# 🔄 React + Redux State Management App

## 🎯 Objective

This project demonstrates how to effectively manage global state in a **ReactJS** application using **Redux**. Built with a modular and scalable architecture, it showcases how Redux simplifies state sharing across deeply nested components, ensuring a predictable and maintainable state flow.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend Framework**: ReactJS
* **State Management**: Redux, React-Redux
* **Development Tools**: Redux DevTools
* **Styling**: CSS & TailwindCSS & Bootstrap

## 🧠 Key Concepts Implemented
* **Redux Store**: Centralized global state container
* **Actions**: Clearly defined events that describe what happened
* **Reducers**: Pure functions that update the state based on actions
* **Dispatching Actions**: Triggering state updates from UI components
* **React-Redux Hooks**: `useSelector` and `useDispatch` for connecting React with Redux
* **Component State Isolation**: Local UI state handled with `useState`, global data with Redux

## 🧩 App Features
* 🔄 **Centralized state management** for better control and debugging
* 📦 **Reusable components** connected to the global store
* 📊 Real-time state updates across the app
* ✅ Uses **Redux DevTools** for easier debugging and state visualization
* 💡 Clean separation between UI logic and state logic


## 📚 Learning Goals
* Understand and implement **Redux architecture** in a React app
* Learn how to **connect components to the global store** using React-Redux
* Improve debugging and state traceability with **Redux DevTools**
* Structure a React + Redux app for **scalability and maintainability**
